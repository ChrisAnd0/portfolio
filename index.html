                <p>A website built as a final project for a course during my time at RIT in 2017, using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.

                <p>A website built as a project for a course duirng my time at RIT in 2016, using HTML, CSS, and PHP. I am an enthusiastic Japanese TCG player, and have had many successes over the years in major events.
